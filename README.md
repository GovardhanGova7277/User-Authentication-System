### User Authentication System: MERN Stack Challenge

---

### üìÅ Project Overview
I developed a user authentication system using the MERN stack. The module allows users to register, log in, view a protected profile page, and log out. The project ensures secure handling of user data with responsive front-end forms and secure back-end API routes.

---

### üéØ Key Features

1. **User Registration:** 
   - Users can register with a username, email, and password. 
   - Passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt`.
  
2. **User Login:** 
   - Users log in using their email and password.
   - `JWT` is used for session management.
  
3. **Profile Page:** 
   - Displays username and email. 
   - Accessible only to logged-in users.
  
4. **Logout Functionality:** 
   - Ends the user session by removing the JWT token.
  
5. **Frontend:** 
   - Built with React.js. 
   - Responsive forms and routing with React Router.
  
6. **Backend:** 
   - API built with Node.js and Express.js.
   - MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage.
   - Secured routes using JWT middleware.
  
7. **Error Handling:** 
   - Proper error handling and display on both frontend and backend.

   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```
3. Start the Express server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
